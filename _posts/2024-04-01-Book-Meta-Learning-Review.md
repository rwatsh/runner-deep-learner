Nice little book about how a person (Radek) went from no comp sci skills to being an ML engineer and also found employment as one in one of the best companies (Nvidia) working in ML space. The book is terse and to the point. Radek's journey and his documenting it in the book has inspired quite a few folks out there - <a href="https://medium.com/@marsgrins/notes-on-meta-learning-by-radek-osmulski-4ece2cf29739">like this</a>. The one thing i benefited in reading this book is the confidence in <a href="https://course.fast.ai">course.fast.ai</a> that Radek has was the only ray of light i needed in selecting one of the several options that are available today of learning about machine learning (and only growing by the day). Other than that i think to a person in the same situation as the author the book may have more appeal (and i am sure there are several out there who want to ride the AI wave and get employed or change careers). Thanks Radek for writing this lovely book!
