Running in Cap10K 2024
======

Today i am running my first Cap10K race in Austin with my family - my wife Aparna and daughter Aarini. Its a great community event and lot of folks we know are participating. My Saturday Run Club has 45 members participating. 

We had a great time at Cap10K - the weather was awesome, bright and sunny and kids had fun running with parents. Since the distance is just 6.1 miles (10K) so lots of families with kids as young as 9yrs were attending the event. My daughter who is about to be 10yr later this month ran with her friend from the neighborhood and completed the course in 1 hr 33 mins, which is a great time for kids. They ran some and walked some. They were elated at the finish line and received their medals with a smile on their faces. Great weather, great company of friends and family, made this a memorable event for us.
